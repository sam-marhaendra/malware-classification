# Malware Classification

This project works on predicting malware types based on commands dataset. In predicting, firstly we calculate word importance using TFIDF, then followed by doing a comparison of the most optimal machine learning model. The compared machine learning model is Logistic Regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), dan K-Nearest Neighbor.
